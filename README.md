HOW TO PLAY?

It is a multiplayer game. The goal of the game is to score 100. The Player who do this first will win. The score is calculated using the sum of number that occur on the dice during the turn. The game begins with the first player. He gets a chance to roll the dice and he can roll the dice until he click on save score or number 1 is achieved on the dice. When he/she clicks on save score button the sum of all the numbers that appeared on the dice during that turn gets save and added to the final score. Then turn is transfered to the second player. If number 1 is encountered on the dice then all the sum of numbers that appeared on the dice during that turn gets lost and nothing gets added to your final score. The one who score a century wins!
